# Amazon S3 Sync Wordpress Plugin
This is a simple plugin, which is part of a bigger project, for a customer who needed to sync U.S. electronic agreements PDFs from their web server to their S3 bucket.

The plugin has a very simple administration page, and it will periodically sync the contents of a specified folder. The path is relative to the upload folder in Wordpress.
